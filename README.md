### Discover Trending Channels 🔥

Explore trending channels across various categories, so you can always stay updated with what's hot on YouTube, all in one place.

### Sophisticated Rating Algorithm 📊

We've designed a sophisticated rating algorithm that takes multiple factors into account to provide a channel rating out of 5. As users rate channels, the system evolves to reflect their preferences.

### Personalized Recommendations Algorithm 🌐

We've taken content discovery to the next level with our graph-based solution for personalized recommendations. Discover how data structures and algorithms play a vital role in enhancing your user experience.The more you use the system, the smarter it becomes at providing recommendations. You can even maintain a favorite channels list or add channels to your wish list to explore them later.

### Secure Authentication 🔐

User data security is a top priority for us. We've implemented Auth0 for seamless and secure user authentication, with faster login and registration processes and zero security breaches.

## Work in Progress 🛠️

While we're thrilled with the progress we've made so far, we consider this project a work in progress. Your feedback and feature requests are invaluable to us. Together, we can make this app even better!

## Technologies Used

Our YouTube Channel Insights and Recommendations Web App is built using a modern technology stack to provide a seamless and feature-rich experience. Here's an overview of the key technologies and how they contribute to the project:

- **Frontend:** We've developed the user interface using React + TypeScript, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a clean and responsive design that ensures an intuitive user experience and DaisyUI.

- **Backend:** The backend of our web app is powered by a combination of MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. MongoDB serves as our database, Express.js as the server framework, and Node.js as the runtime environment. This robust stack ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and server-side processing.

- **Authentication:** We've integrated Auth0 for user authentication. It offers a secure and streamlined authentication process, reducing the risk of security breaches and providing a seamless login and registration experience for our users.

- **Recommendation Engine:** Our recommendation engine is a custom solution that utilizes a graph-based approach. It enhances content discovery by creating connections between channels, allowing for efficient and personalized recommendations.

- **Other Features:** In addition to the core functionality, our web app offers several features, including dark mode for user comfort during night-time browsing, trending channels to stay updated with popular content, user reviews and ratings for channel feedback, and the ability to create wishlists and maintain a list of favorite channels.
